#Why are generators better than iterators?
#You can implement your own iterator using a python class; a generator does not need a class in python.
#To write a python generator, you can either use a Python function or a comprehension. But for an iterator, you must use the iter() and next() functions.
#Generator in python let us write fast and compact code. They are also simpler to code than do custom iterator.
